                    My name is Teddy Gonyea and I'm a 21 year old Computer Science student at Indiana University. I
                    spend a lot of time studying Chinese. In the future I am interested in developing language learning
                    technologies. I have a background in music performance and comoposition. I play piano and rudimental
                    snare drum, and enjoy music production. Currently, I instruct the Drumline at Bloomington High
                    School South.

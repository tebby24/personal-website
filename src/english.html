        <h1>English Lessons</h1>
        <p>I teach one-on-one English lessons online to native speakers of Mandarin. You can contact me via WeChat or
            Line if you are interested.</p>

        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>Learning a language takes a lot more than just weekly lessons with a tutor. If you want to make real
            progress, you have to spend lots of time studying on your own. Durring our lessons, I'll help you
            setup an effective and efficient study routine that makes use of modern language learning technologies.
        </p>
        <p>Once we have established an effective way for you to study, our lessons will remain mostly
            conversational. Put simply, you should be learning new words during your independent study time, and
            during lessons I will help you practice applying thoes words in real conversation. </p>

        <h3>Pricing</h3>
        <p>25 minute lesson: $10<br />50 minute lesson: $20</p>

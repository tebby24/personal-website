        <h1>Mandarin</h1>
        <p>I've been studying Mandarin Chinese since late 2021. I've made significant progress in the language and anticipate reaching some degree of fluency around 2026. </p>    

        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>When I initially began to seriously study mandarin, I was very much sold on Stephen Krashen's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis">Input Hypothesis</a>.</p>

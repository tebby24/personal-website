    <h1>Mandarin</h1>
    <p>I've been studying Mandarin Chinese since late 2021. I've made significant progress with that language and intend
        to continue studying until I reach a degree of fluency comparible to an educated native speaker.</p>

    <h2>Current Level</h2>
    <p>Here are some examples of me speaking mandarin: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>(May 2024) <a href="https://youtu.be/XdiD8K_P-gU?si=lPiTVJqYDCAFI6zP">Dashu Mandarin Podcast - Ep. 99</a>
        </li>
        <li>(April 2023) <a href="https://youtu.be/jj_M1aWpuYQ">IU Chinese Speech Contest</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>When I initially began to seriously study mandarin, I was very much sold on Stephen Krashen's <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis">Input Hypothesis</a>. Nowadays, I still think that
        languages are acquired when we understand messages, but my own opinion greatly diverges from Krashen's at one
        very important point, namely, the existance of a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_period_hypothesis">critical period</a>, and closing of the <a
            href="acquisitin">language acquisition device</a>. I've heard Krashen say multiple times that he thinks the
        LAD does not close, implying that adults can acquire language in the same way that children do. Krashen believes
        that the discrepency in language learning success between adults and children is caused by something he calls
        the "affective filter," which I interpret as an adult's ego interfering with their ability to acquire the
        language. </p>
    <p>I disagree with the affective filter hypethesis, and I disagree that the LAD stays open. I think that just as
        people stop growing taller, natural language, as Chomsky <a
            href="https://youtu.be/hdUbIlwHRkY?si=60JLx9X3G0oq93iv&t=637">puts it</a>, stops growing in our heads.
        Children acquire
        their native language effortlessly simply by being situated in an environment where the langauge is used. In
        contrast, Adults, as far as I can tell, need to put in a lot of intentional effort to make progress. That being
        said, I don't think that adults lose the ability to acquire language entirely. I believe the solution to second
        language acquisition lies in analysis of the functions children put to use when processing their language input,
        determining which of theses functions are lost in adults, and filling in thoes gaps with technology assisted
        intentional study.</p>

    <h2>Study Workflow</h2>
    <p>I study with combonation of active immersion, passive listening and spaced repetition. I actively immerse in
        content such as TV dramas, podcasts, or educational videos about topics I'm interested in. I only watch content
        that has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/9anime/comments/16ivuki/whats_is_soft_sub/">soft subtitles</a>. I
        look up every word I don't know using yomitan and add it to my wordbank. If a word has been banked 2 or more
        times, it gets tossed in the review list, which I quickly review using quick quiz once it reaches 10 words. If a
        word gets banked for the 3rd time, I make an anki card out of the sentence it came from.
